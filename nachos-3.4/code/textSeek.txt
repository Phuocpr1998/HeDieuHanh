make life

When tears fell from my eyes, 
you were there to brush them away.
When I was lost in confusion, 
you were there to say that everything would be okay.
When I stood before you falling apart,
you were there to lend your heart.
When I felt like no one could understand,
you were there to take my hand.
When no one else was left to care,
you were there.
